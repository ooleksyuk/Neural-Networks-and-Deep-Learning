1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.430
in this video I want to help you gain an

2
00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.010
intuitive understanding of calculus and

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.260
the derivatives now maybe you're

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.480
thinking that you haven't seen calculus

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.519
since your college days and depending on

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.190
when you graduate maybe that was quite

7
00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.650
some time back now if that's what you're

8
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.990
thinking don't worry you don't need a

9
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.480
deep understanding of calculus in order

10
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.180
to apply new networks and deep learning

11
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.070
very effectively so if you're watching

12
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.230
this video or some of the later videos

13
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.520
be wondering wow this stuff really for

14
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.590
me this calculus looks really

15
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.750
complicated my advice to you is the

16
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.820
following which is that watch the videos

17
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.350
and then if you could do the homework

18
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.360
and complete the programming homework

19
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.910
successfully then you can apply deep

20
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.340
learning in fact what you see later is

21
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.170
that in week 4 will define a couple of

22
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.120
types of functions that will enable you

23
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.100
to encapsulate everything that needs to

24
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.600
be done with respect to calculus that

25
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.190
these functions call forward functions

26
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.500
and backward functions that you learn

27
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.270
about the less you put everything you

28
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.920
need to know about counselors into these

29
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.320
functions so that you don't need to

30
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.659
worry about them anymore beyond that but

31
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.090
I thought that in this foray into deep

32
00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.799
learning that this week we should open

33
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.439
up the box and peer a little bit further

34
00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.760
into the details of calculus but really

35
00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.159
all you need is an intuitive

36
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.780
understanding of this in order to build

37
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.259
and successfully apply these algorithms

38
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.299
oh and finally if you are among that

39
00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.979
maybe smaller group of people that are

40
00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.229
expert in calculus if you're very

41
00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.820
familiar with calculus observe this it's

42
00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.460
probably okay for you to skip this video

43
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.650
but for everyone else let's dive in and

44
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.810
try to get an intuitive understanding of

45
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.079
derivatives I've plotted here the

46
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.329
function f of a equals 3/8 so it's just

47
00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.159
a straight line to gain intuition about

48
00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.560
derivatives let's look at a few points

49
00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.189
on this function let's say that a is

50
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.820
equal to 2 in that case f of a which is

51
00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.939
equal to 3 times 8 is equal to 6 so if a

52
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.159
is equal to 2 then you know F of a will

53
00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.930
be equal to 6 let's say we give the

54
00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.600
value of a you know just a little bit of

55
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.780
a nudge I'm going to just bump up me a

56
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.670
little bit so there is now 2.00 1 right

57
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.680
so I'm going to get a like a tiny little

58
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.040
nudge to the right so now is let's say 2

59
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.060
oh one this plug this is to scale 2.01

60
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.230
the 0.001 difference is too small to

61
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.840
show on this plot this give them a

62
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.540
little nudge to the right now f of a is

63
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.540
equal to three times at so six point

64
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.060
zero zero three Simplot this over here

65
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.579
this is not the scale this is six point

66
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.280
zero zero three so if you look at this

67
00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:40.719
low triangle here some highlighting in

68
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.299
green what we see is that if I match a

69
00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:49.340
0.001 to the right then F of a goes up

70
00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:52.040
by 0.03 the amount that F of a went up

71
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.829
is three times as big as the amount that

72
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.189
I judged a to the right so we're going

73
00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:02.870
to say that the slope of the derivative

74
00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:05.569
of the function f of a at a equals two

75
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.849
or when a is equal to 2 the slope this

76
00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.650
reading and you know the term derivative

77
00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.900
basically means slope is just that

78
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.879
derivative sound like a scary a more

79
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.010
intimidating word whereas slope is a

80
00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.479
friendlier way to describe the concept

81
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.729
of derivative so one of these year

82
00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:22.129
derivative just think slope of the

83
00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:26.150
function and more formally the slope is

84
00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:28.519
defined as the height divided by the

85
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.760
width of this little triangle that we

86
00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:35.329
have in green so this is you know 0.03

87
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.310
over 0.01 and the fact that the slope is

88
00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.859
equal to 3 or the derivative is equal 3

89
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.829
just represents the fact that when you

90
00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.979
watch a to the right by 0.01 by tiny

91
00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.739
amount the amount that F of a goes up is

92
00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:51.349
three times as big as the amount that

93
00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.299
United the inertial a in the horizontal

94
00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.310
direction so that's all that the slope

95
00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.439
of a line is now let's look at this

96
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.959
function at a different point let's say

97
00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.299
that a is now equal to five

98
00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.939
in that case f of a three times a is

99
00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.169
equal to 15 so let's say I again give a

100
00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.150
and notch to the right

101
00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:10.430
a tiny longnecks is now bumped up to

102
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.180
five point over one F of a is three

103
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.030
times that

104
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.079
so f of a is equal to fifteen point zero

105
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.779
three and so once again when I bump into

106
00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.360
the right not a to the right by 0.001

107
00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:27.020
F of a goes up three times as much

108
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.810
so the slope again at a equals five is

109
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.449
also three so the way we write is that

110
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:38.389
the slope of the function f is equal to

111
00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:40.909
three we say D F of a da and this just

112
00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.610
means the slope of the function f of a

113
00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:46.969
when you nudge the variable a a tiny

114
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.909
little amount um this is equal to three

115
00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:52.400
and an alternative way to write this

116
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:57.740
derivative formula is as follows you can

117
00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:00.199
also write this as d da of f of a so

118
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.969
whether you put the f of a on top of

119
00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.810
whether you write it you know down here

120
00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.120
it doesn't matter

121
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.090
but all those equation means is that if

122
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.940
I nudge a to the right a little bit

123
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.400
I expect F of a to go up by three times

124
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:17.270
as much as I not just the value of

125
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.029
little a now for this video I explained

126
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:25.729
derivatives talking about what happens

127
00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:27.379
we nudge the variable a by 0.001 um if

128
00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.610
you want the formal mathematical

129
00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.190
definition of the derivatives

130
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.740
derivatives are defined with an even

131
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.909
smaller value of how much energy a to

132
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:42.710
the right so it's not open over 1 is not

133
00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:44.960
0.001 is not 0.0 and so on 1 is sort of

134
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.360
even smaller than that and the formal

135
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.909
definition of derivative says what have

136
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.379
you nudge a to the right by an info

137
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:54.379
testable amount basically an infinite

138
00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:57.319
infinitely tiny tiny amount if you do

139
00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:59.240
that does f of a go up three times as

140
00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:01.219
much as whatever was a tiny tiny tiny

141
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.409
amount that you now stay to the right so

142
00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:05.870
that's actually the formal definition of

143
00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.819
a derivative but for the purposes of our

144
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.800
intuitive understanding we're going to

145
00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:13.569
talk about nudging a to the right by

146
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.909
this small amount 0.001 even if it's

147
00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:19.879
0.001 isn't exactly you know tiny tiny

148
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:22.639
insa testable now one property of the

149
00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:24.529
derivative is that no matter where you

150
00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.169
take the slope of this function it is

151
00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:30.050
equal to 3 whether a is equal to 2 or a

152
00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:33.289
is equal to 5 the slope of this function

153
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.599
is equal to 3 meaning that whatever is

154
00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.139
the value of a if you increase it by

155
00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.509
0.001 that

156
00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:41.669
value of f of a goes up by three times

157
00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:43.229
as much so this function has the same

158
00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:45.569
slope everywhere and one way to see that

159
00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:48.689
is that wherever you draw this your

160
00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:51.900
little triangle right the height divided

161
00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:54.120
by the width always has a ratio of three

162
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.919
to one so I hope this gives you a sense

163
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.840
of what the slope what the derivative of

164
00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.879
the function means for a straight line

165
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.639
where in this example the slope of the

166
00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:04.199
function was three everywhere in the

167
00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:06.419
next video let's take a look at a

168
00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:08.310
slightly more complex example where the

169
00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:11.479
slopes of the function can be different

170
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.479
at different points on the function
