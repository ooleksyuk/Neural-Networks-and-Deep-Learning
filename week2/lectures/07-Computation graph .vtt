00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You've heard me say that the computations of a neural network are

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.253
organized in terms of a forward pass or a forward propagation step,

3
00:00:07.253 --> 00:00:10.005
in which we compute the output of the neural network,

4
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.310
followed by a backward pass or back propagation step,

5
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.137
which we use to compute gradients or compute derivatives.

6
00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:21.540
The computation graph explains why it is organized this way.

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.375
In this video, we'll go through an example.

8
00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:28.060
In order to illustrate the computation graph,

9
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.260
let's use a simpler example than logistic regression or a full blown neural network.

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.200
Let's say that we're trying to compute a function, J,

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.510
which is a function of three variables a, b,

12
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.900
and c and let's say that function is 3(a+bc).

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.260
Computing this function actually has three distinct steps.

14
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.799
The first is you need to compute what is

15
00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.195
bc and let's say we store that in the variable call u.

16
00:00:55.195 --> 00:00:59.117
So u=bc and then you my compute V=a *u.

17
00:00:59.117 --> 00:01:06.060
So let's say this is V. And then finally,

18
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.380
your output J is 3V.

19
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.555
So this is your final function J that you're trying to compute.

20
00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:20.970
We can take these three steps and draw them in a computation graph as follows.

21
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.400
Let's say, I draw your three variables a, b, and c here.

22
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.825
So the first thing we did was compute u=bc.

23
00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:35.015
So I'm going to put a rectangular box around that.

24
00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:39.030
And so the input to that are b and c. And then,

25
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.505
you might have V=a+u.

26
00:01:41.505 --> 00:01:47.440
So the inputs to that

27
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:56.645
are V. So the inputs to that are u with just computed together with a.

28
00:01:56.645 --> 00:02:04.205
And then finally, we have J=3V.

29
00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:07.235
So as a concrete example, if a=5,

30
00:02:07.235 --> 00:02:10.040
b=3 and c=2 then u=bc would be six because

31
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.967
a+u would be 5+6 is 11, J is three times that, so J=33.

32
00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:22.310
And indeed, hopefully you can verify

33
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.520
that this is three times five plus three times two.

34
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.865
And if you expand that out,

35
00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:34.390
you actually get 33 as the value of J.

36
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.060
So, the computation graph comes in handy when there is

37
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.790
some distinguished or some special output variable,

38
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.940
such as J in this case,

39
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.215
that you want to optimize.

40
00:02:46.215 --> 00:02:48.755
And in the case of a logistic regression,

41
00:02:48.755 --> 00:02:53.260
J is of course the cos function that we're trying to minimize.

42
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.615
And what we're seeing in this little example is that,

43
00:02:56.615 --> 00:02:58.666
through a left-to-right pass,

44
00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:01.075
you can compute the value of J.

45
00:03:01.075 --> 00:03:05.993
And what we'll see in the next couple of slides is that in order to compute derivatives,

46
00:03:05.993 --> 00:03:10.010
there'll be a right-to-left pass like this,

47
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.380
kind of going in the opposite direction as the blue arrows.

48
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.205
That would be most natural for computing the derivatives.

49
00:03:17.205 --> 00:03:20.015
So to recap, the computation graph organizes

50
00:03:20.015 --> 00:03:24.250
a computation with this blue arrow, left-to-right computation.

51
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.510
Let's refer to the next video how you can do

52
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.710
the backward red arrow right-to-left computation of the derivatives.

53
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.000
Let's go on to the next video.
