00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.850
There's been a lot of hype
about neural networks.

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.170
And perhaps some of that hype is
justified, given how well they're working.

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.220
But it turns out that so

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.710
far, almost all the economic value created
by neural networks has been through

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.970
one type of machine learning,
called supervised learning.

6
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.120
Let's see what that means, and
let's go over some examples.

7
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.030
In supervised learning,
you have some input x, and

8
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.210
you want to learn a function
mapping to some output y.

9
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.890
So for example, just now we saw the
housing price prediction application where

10
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.850
you input some features of a home and
try to output or estimate the price y.

11
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.180
Here are some other examples that neural
networks have been applied to very

12
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.940
effectively.

13
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.180
Possibly the single most lucrative
application of deep learning today is

14
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.150
online advertising, maybe not the most
inspiring, but certainly very lucrative,

15
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.770
in which, by inputting information about
an ad to the website it's thinking

16
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.020
of showing you, and some information
about the user, neural networks have

17
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.700
gotten very good at predicting whether or
not you click on an ad.

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.770
And by showing you and

19
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.800
showing users the ads that you are most
likely to click on, this has been

20
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.830
an incredibly lucrative application of
neural networks at multiple companies.

21
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.040
Because the ability to show you
ads that you're more likely to

22
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.690
click on has a direct impact on the bottom

23
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.209
line of some of the very large
online advertising companies.

24
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.150
Computer vision has also made huge
strides in the last several years,

25
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.050
mostly due to deep learning.

26
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.140
So you might input an image and
want to output an index,

27
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.295
say from 1 to 1,000 trying
to tell you if this picture,

28
00:01:42.295 --> 00:01:44.305
it might be any one of,
say a 1000 different images.

29
00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:47.505
So, you might us that for photo tagging.

30
00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:51.525
I think the recent progress in speech
recognition has also been very exciting,

31
00:01:51.525 --> 00:01:54.915
where you can now input an audio
clip to a neural network, and

32
00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:57.930
have it output a text transcript.

33
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.400
Machine translation has also made huge
strides thanks to deep learning where now

34
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.400
you can have a neural network input an
English sentence and directly output say,

35
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.010
a Chinese sentence.

36
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.930
And in autonomous driving, you might input
an image, say a picture of what's in

37
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.600
front of your car as well as some
information from a radar, and

38
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.080
based on that, maybe a neural network
can be trained to tell you the position

39
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.100
of the other cars on the road.

40
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.870
So this becomes a key component
in autonomous driving systems.

41
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.730
So a lot of the value creation through
neural networks has been through cleverly

42
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.360
selecting what should be x and
what should be y for

43
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.000
your particular problem, and then fitting
this supervised learning component into

44
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.660
often a bigger system such
as an autonomous vehicle.

45
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.880
It turns out that slightly different
types of neural networks are useful for

46
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.965
different applications.

47
00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:57.105
For example, in the real estate
application that we saw in the previous

48
00:02:57.105 --> 00:03:01.525
video, we use a universally standard
neural network architecture, right?

49
00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:05.515
Maybe for real estate and
online advertising might be a relatively

50
00:03:05.515 --> 00:03:08.625
standard neural network,
like the one that we saw.

51
00:03:10.415 --> 00:03:16.120
For image applications we'll often
use convolution on neural networks,

52
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.680
often abbreviated CNN.

53
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.000
And for sequence data.

54
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.840
So for example,
audio has a temporal component, right?

55
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.990
Audio is played out over time, so
audio is most naturally represented

56
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.110
as a one-dimensional time series or
as a one-dimensional temporal sequence.

57
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.420
And so for sequence data,
you often use an RNN,

58
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.810
a recurrent neural network.

59
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.270
Language, English and Chinese, the
alphabets or the words come one at a time.

60
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.825
So language is also most naturally
represented as sequence data.

61
00:03:51.825 --> 00:03:57.700
And so more complex versions of RNNs
are often used for these applications.

62
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.360
And then, for more complex applications,
like autonomous driving, where you have

63
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.201
an image, that might suggest more of a CNN
convolution neural network structure and

64
00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:09.480
radar info which is
something quite different.

65
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.362
You might end up with a more custom, or

66
00:04:12.362 --> 00:04:16.880
some more complex,
hybrid neural network architecture.

67
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.102
So, just to be a bit more concrete
about what are the standard CNN and

68
00:04:23.102 --> 00:04:24.950
RNN architectures.

69
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.790
So in the literature you might
have seen pictures like this.

70
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.742
So that's a standard neural net.

71
00:04:31.742 --> 00:04:33.800
You might have seen pictures like this.

72
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.830
Well this is an example of a Convolutional
Neural Network, and we'll see in

73
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.958
a later course exactly what this picture
means and how can you implement this.

74
00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:48.560
But convolutional networks
are often use for image data.

75
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.100
And you might also have
seen pictures like this.

76
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.590
And you'll learn how to implement
this in a later course.

77
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.180
Recurrent neural networks
are very good for

78
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.220
this type of one-dimensional sequence
data that has maybe a temporal component.

79
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.310
You might also have heard about
applications of machine learning

80
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.000
to both Structured Data and
Unstructured Data.

81
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.960
Here's what the terms mean.

82
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.620
Structured Data means
basically databases of data.

83
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.010
So, for example, in housing price
prediction, you might have a database or

84
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.140
the column that tells you the size and
the number of bedrooms.

85
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.460
So, this is structured data, or
in predicting whether or not a user will

86
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.332
click on an ad, you might have information
about the user, such as the age,

87
00:05:34.332 --> 00:05:38.590
some information about the ad, and then
labels why that you're trying to predict.

88
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.470
So that's structured data,
meaning that each of the features,

89
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.740
such as size of the house,
the number of bedrooms, or

90
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.530
the age of a user,
has a very well defined meaning.

91
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.520
In contrast, unstructured data refers
to things like audio, raw audio,

92
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.795
or images where you might want to
recognize what's in the image or text.

93
00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:06.235
Here the features might be
the pixel values in an image or

94
00:06:06.235 --> 00:06:09.195
the individual words in a piece of text.

95
00:06:09.195 --> 00:06:11.335
Historically, it has been much harder for

96
00:06:11.335 --> 00:06:16.480
computers to make sense of unstructured
data compared to structured data.

97
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.270
And the fact the human race has evolved
to be very good at understanding

98
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.278
audio cues as well as images.

99
00:06:23.278 --> 00:06:25.390
And then text was a more recent invention,
but

100
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.760
people are just really good at
interpreting unstructured data.

101
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.800
And so one of the most exciting things
about the rise of neural networks is that,

102
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.280
thanks to deep learning, thanks to neural
networks, computers are now much better

103
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.320
at interpreting unstructured data as
well compared to just a few years ago.

104
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.240
And this creates opportunities for
many new exciting applications that use

105
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.229
speech recognition, image recognition,
natural language processing on text,

106
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.180
much more than was possible even
just two or three years ago.

107
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.940
I think because people have a natural
empathy to understanding unstructured

108
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.250
data, you might hear about neural
network successes on unstructured data

109
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.060
more in the media because it's just cool
when the neural network recognizes a cat.

110
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.750
We all like that, and
we all know what that means.

111
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.290
But it turns out that a lot of short
term economic value that neural

112
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.270
networks are creating has
also been on structured data,

113
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.690
such as much better advertising systems,
much better profit recommendations, and

114
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.730
just a much better ability to
process the giant databases that

115
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.290
many companies have to make
accurate predictions from them.

116
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.230
So in this course, a lot of
the techniques we'll go over will apply

117
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.690
to both structured data and
to unstructured data.

118
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.970
For the purposes of
explaining the algorithms,

119
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:49.210
we will draw a little bit more on
examples that use unstructured data.

120
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.280
But as you think through applications of
neural networks within your own team I

121
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.360
hope you find both uses for them in
both structured and unstructured data.

122
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.390
So neural networks have transformed
supervised learning and

123
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.500
are creating tremendous economic value.

124
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.910
It turns out though, that the basic
technical ideas behind neural networks

125
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.520
have mostly been around,
sometimes for many decades.

126
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.980
So why is it, then, that they're only
just now taking off and working so well?

127
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.970
In the next video, we'll talk
about why it's only quite recently

128
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.940
that neural networks have become this
incredibly powerful tool that you can use.
